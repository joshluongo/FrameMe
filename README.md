# FrameMe

Quickly frame iOS screenshots, this is designed to use frames from https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/#product-bezels

## Why?

While [fastlane/frameit](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/frameit/) is an excellent screenshot framing tool it relies on device frames from Facebook which often take a long time to recevive new device images, this is a simple tool to use the offical Apple device "bezels".

In theory this could work with any type of device frames as the masks are dynamically generated.
